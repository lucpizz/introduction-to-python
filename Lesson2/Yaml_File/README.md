# JSON Creators

Takes in a series of inputs and writes them to a JSON file.

## Schema for the inputs

        "description": "",
        "version": "",
        "author": "",
        "license": "",
        "posts":  [
        {
            "title": "",
            "date": "",
            "content": ""
        }
        ]
    }
```

Who is the end user?
